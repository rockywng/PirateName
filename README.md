# Pirate-Name
This project uses the Racket htdp library's GUI toolkit to build a very simple GUI. Input your name and receive your pirate name! One of the assignments I had to complete for the CS135 course at Waterloo had us do something very similar to this, just without the GUI. As I was reminiscing about my first semester of university, I remembered how fun this assignment was, and of course, I had to recreate it. It's incredibly simple, but I had a lot of fun building a GUI in Racket, and had even more fun using it!

## Usage
Download the Racket file and open it with DrRacket. Click on Run (which should be in the top right corner of DrRacket) and a popup should appear. Enter your name in the text box and select Enterrr to submit your name and find ye pirate name. You can submit more names afterwards, if you would like. When you are finished you can either close the popup by selecting the exit button in the top right, or, if you would like to try out Racket's GUI features, you can select the button labeled Exit at the bottom right of the popup window.
